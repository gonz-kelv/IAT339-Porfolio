					<h2> DRIVEN, CREATIVE, TECHNICAL</h2>
					<p>Developer To Be</p>
					<p>I am an aspiring developer. I feel like a detective when I code. There is a problem that I need to solve and I am looking for the solution. Debugging leaves trails that will lead me to a clue on how to solve the case. In the end, its rewarding when I get the job done. Case closed!<p>
					<p>I love the world of technology. I am fascinated how it can help people do things more efficient. However, it can become a double edge sword and make us very inefficient hehe.</p>
					<p>Im interested in video game development as I am a gamer.</p>

					<h2>First Person Fighting Game</h2>
						<p>I was the Gameplay Programmer of this project. I created a Hitbox system using Colliders available in Unity. I implemented a simple User interface by having a common health bar located in the top and a red screen flashing on the screen if User gets hit from the enemy</p>
