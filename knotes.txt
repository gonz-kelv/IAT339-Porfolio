					<h2>First Person Fighting Game</h2>
						<p>I was the Gameplay Programmer of this project. I created a Hitbox system using Colliders available in Unity. I implemented a simple User interface by having a common health bar located in the top and a red screen flashing on the screen if User gets hit from the enemy</p>
